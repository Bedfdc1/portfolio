									<h3>The Development Triangle</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									For this project, I have decided to use <a href="http://www.gamefroot.com/">Gamefroot</a> as my primary online development tool. GameFront utilizes drag and drop "Scratch" style design mechanics for coding, meaning that I can focus on the design and assets of my planned game, without having to get too bogged down in the technical programming side of things. It also has the added advantage of exporting the full project out to and easy to embed I-frame, which means I can easily manipulate the size of it on the web page and not have to worry about the file size being too large and slowing down the page load speed.

									Gamefroot Has an in-built animator for its character designs; It intakes a series of Sprites for the various states of the character model, this has afforded me to be able to use the Adobe suite in what I will call the Development Triangle. I have used Adobe Illustrator as my primary tool for creating assets. This was done due to the ease of use of making cubic shapes in Illustator; it was also due to the fact that I can drag my assets out of Illustrator and into Adobe Animate. It retains all of Its Layers and shapes properties, which makes animating things a dream. Next, I used Adobe animate to make all of my assets dynamic, this was used to make my running, idle, and dying animations. Animate has a handy function of being able to export Symbols out as sprite sheets; this meant that all I had to do was export my animation as a sheet, cut it up in Adobe Photoshop, and then re-assemble the sprites in Gamefroots built-in sequencer. Success!

									<h3>Asset Managment and Version Control</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Because I was using Gamefroots online animator and exporting out individual keyframes as PNG's, I ended up with a lot of files. I set up a simple asset folder that segmented these out into groups; these would be; Character Sprites, Enemy / Item Sprites, Background & Menu files, and a separate folder in which I kept all of the Raw Animate / Illustrator / PS Files. As for Individual file names, they were kept to one word and a number so that I knew what animation they were for, and what frame they were. This made reassembling things incredibly easy; for example, if I wanted the Death animation, I knew I just needed to go in the character folder, find the files named death, and reconstruct them in numerical order.  
								</p>

								<br>
								<p>Due to me nearly deleting a project earlier in the semester and it putting the fear of God in me, I decided to version control all of my files. This was done with the usual git repository. I was also skeptical about keeping all of my build progress online on Gamefroots servers as I didn't really know how safe they were. Game Froot, however, allows you to download and import your project data as JSON files, so at the end of every build sprint, I would download a new JSON file and store it in my Git repository just incase.</p>
