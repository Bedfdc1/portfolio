									<h3>Concept</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									It was a Rainy summer Dunedin day, and Dion thought to himself, "How can I make a cohesive and original with little to no artistic talent" On that day, Brickasso was born. The idea was simple, to use the colors and cubic nature of a Picasso design and put them into a 2D platforming experience. In this way, I could try and use my design skills and limited basic shape drawing skills to build a short, fun, and unique experience.

									<h3>The Development Triangle</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									For this project, I have decided to use <a href="http://www.gamefroot.com/">Gamefroot</a> as my primary online development tool. GameFront utilizes drag and drop "Scratch" style design mechanics for coding, meaning that I can focus on the design and assets of my planned game, without having to get too bogged down in the technical programming side of things. It also has the added advantage of exporting the full project out to and easy to embed I-frame, which means I can easily manipulate the size of it on the web page and not have to worry about the file size being too large and slowing down the page load speed.

								<br>
								<p>	
									Gamefroot Has an in-built animator for its character designs; It intakes a series of Sprites for the various states of the character model, this has afforded me to be able to use the Adobe suite in what I will call the Development Triangle. I have used Adobe Illustrator as my primary tool for creating assets. This was done due to the ease of use of making cubic shapes in Illustator; it was also due to the fact that I can drag my assets out of Illustrator and into Adobe Animate. It retains all of Its Layers and shapes properties, which makes animating things a dream. Next, I used Adobe animate to make all of my assets dynamic, this was used to make my running, idle, and dying animations. Animate has a handy function of being able to export Symbols out as sprite sheets; this meant that all I had to do was export my animation as a sheet, cut it up in Adobe Photoshop, and then re-assemble the sprites in Gamefroots built-in sequencer. Due to the project ending up as an inbuilt iframe, and the fact that the images themselves were relatively simple, I have chosen to export them as PNGS as this will be the best quality for the job, and the file sizes won't be gigantic. Success!

									<h3>Asset Managment and Version Control</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Because I was using Gamefroots online animator and exporting out individual keyframes as PNG's, I ended up with a lot of files. I set up a simple asset folder that segmented these out into groups; these would be; Character Sprites, Enemy / Item Sprites, Background & Menu files, and a separate folder in which I kept all of the Raw Animate / Illustrator / PS Files. As for Individual file names, they were kept to one word and a number so that I knew what animation they were for, and what frame they were. This made reassembling things incredibly easy; for example, if I wanted the Death animation, I knew I just needed to go in the character folder, find the files named death, and reconstruct them in numerical order.

								<br>
								<p>Due to me nearly deleting a project earlier in the semester and it putting the fear of God in me, I decided to version control all of my files. This was done with the usual git repository. I was also skeptical about keeping all of my build progress online on Gamefroots servers as I didn't really know how safe they were. Game Froot, however, allows you to download and import your project data as JSON files, so at the end of every build sprint, I would download a new JSON file and store it in my Git repository just incase.</p>

									<h3>Picasso Art Research</h3>
								</header>
								<p> Given that I don`t know that much about cubism, I did some research on some Picasso pieces to see the general style of his compositions. When making his character model, although it was going to be quite simplistic, I wanted it to capture a particular Cubic inspiration.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Paying attention to the first and last portraits, I wanted the game world to have contrasts of vibrant color and bleak pastel tones. With the character model being straightforward, I wanted his eye to be the main focal point designing it with a cubic, but also Pink Floyd "Division Bell" feel.</p>

									<h3>2d Platformer and Game Design</h3>
								</header>
								<p>As I was building the game, I did a wee bit of research into basic design concepts for level building and standard 2D design conventions for things such as placements of Healthbars, Life Totals, and scoreboards. I've mainly used screenshots such as the ones below to base placements more than anything. From my research, it would seem that as a user, you commonly expect to see your health bar in the top left-hand corner of the screen, along with any held items or things of interest, and your life total or score to be kept in the top left-hand corner of the screen.</p>

								<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As far as actual game design goes, I found the video above to be pretty useful. Some fresh takeaways were small things like: </p>
								<ul style="padding: 0 30px;">
									<li style="list-style-type: square">Keeping pixel sizes for Terrain and player models will help the game feel unified.</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: square">Having dynamic movement on your character when it is not doing anything can help it feel more alive.</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: square">During your development cycle, always keep your game in a finishable state; this means that if something goes wrong or you don't finish it for whatever reason, that you will always have something workable to present to your client.</li>
								</ul>

									<h3>Initial Game Designs and Mockups</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the original plan for the level design. For simplicity and time, I have forgone the use of enemies and decided to use environmental hazards and basic platforming to make the level fun. The Key will be visible but not reachable on screen from the top, and the path to it will be visible but not reachable from the bottom; hopefully, this is enough to give the player a fair idea that they should try jumping in the fake hazard to get there. A lot of the level is inspired by learning that a leap of faith into the unknown will usually be rewarded, except for the fake faith leap at the bottom. The background of the level should remain Neutral as I intend to have the tiles and items to have a neon almost psychedelic feel.</p>

								<p>The Focus of the character model should be his eye, I’ve done this in a kind of abstract 2D / 3D Fashion where he could be both looking forward, and at you at the same time, Much the same has been done with his ear on the left-hand side. I’ve drawn it in two halves so’s to try and represent both of his ears, and one ear at the same time. His hair is a textured block of squares meant to be textured and layered while remaining 2D. I’ve tried my best here to design something i think fits with the style conventions. While it remains simple, there has been some thought put into the design on him.</p>

								</div>
								<p>I have drawn up the opening screen title and buttons. The title is disjointed, and out of proportion on purpose, as to be as abstract as possible. I have kept the background color as the same solid color that will feature throughout the level; this has been done for continuity.</p>

							<p>As game collectibles go, I made every asset in the game from scratch. It's also worth noting here that I put far to much time into making sure that all of my animations for the collectibles ran at different speeds. This was to help give everything its own feel and improve the experience to feel a wee bit more dynamic.</p>
