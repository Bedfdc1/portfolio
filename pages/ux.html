								<p>Mobile Hospitality POS</p>

							<h3>Summary</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								For this Design assessment, I have decided to redesign a point of sale application for the front of house staff within hospitality businesses.
								​
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently, some applications are integrated into till systems that allow the front of house staff to write down their order at the table and then order it at the till. Slowly we are beginning to see mobile applications appear with the use of tablets or mobile phone devices. Applications for these devices tend, however, to be cumbersome. Developers have just tried to directly port precisely what is on the till system to the mobile device without thought for what the server actually needs at the table. 
							</p>
							<p>Hospitality is a fast-paced industry; servers need to be able to find what they need quickly at a glance. The current workflow is hindered by applications that cram too much unnecessary information into small screen space; I think I can improve on this.  The idea is a clean, functional design with color codes for things such as allergies; this means that a server can quickly scan and recite information when needed. 

								With each server having their own mobile device for the application, it leads to the possibility of the servers being able to log into these devices. This would mean that they could track their hours through the device and that the application would be able to show only the relevant information to each server.  User experience increases with this development decision as it reduces the amount of information needed on each screen to only what is relevant to each user. This information could include only tables that are in each servers section and advice/color coordination for any allergy / special requirements for those tables.</p>

									<h3>Workflow Choices</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									For the Project, I decided to use two main programs, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Thes are industry standard for creating logos icons and image manipulation so the choice was a simple one. all files were exported at medium quality as to not be too large and adversely affect web loading times. As for the web page, I decided to use Wix. Usually, for web development, I like to avoid "cookie-cutter" online CMS systems, however, for a design and portfolio project the content management and fast redesign potential suited my needs better than coding from scratch.

									<h3>Wireframes</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Below are Wireframes for 3 screens; The login Screen, Main Hub, and Main ordering screen. These are designed around a Samsung Galaxy 3 tablet screen size (9.7") as I thought that this was a which is a moderately priced tablet realistically affordable to hospitality businesses.

									<h4>Home / Login Screen</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									This screen has been kept clean with only things that are important being large or bold.



The company name is placed at the bottom. This position is where it is expected to be found, and it helps identify the device with the company if it is ever lost.

The time is near the top and is essential as it will be the employee's point of reference for when they should be starting their shifts.



The main focal point of the screen is the login section as it is the reason the employees are there in the first place.

								<p>
										Color Scheme has remained neutral throughout.

										Baskerville has been used as the Font throughout as sources say it conveys a strong sence of reliability;
